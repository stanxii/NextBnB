# NextBnB
A clone of AirBnB core functions using Next.js, with full server-side rendering and a functioning backend. 


Edit: I wasted a lot of time reading and planning functions out, which turned out to be just a diversion and not what I need to do. This will be finished out in one to two days, with only MVP features put in. This is following a text tutorial, which is two levels easier than doing a project myself, but this will serve as a simple warm up to my Kanban/Teaching platform that I will be building out from Monday to Friday.

Simple Roadmap:

Build out React App and relearn Routers (look at Tyler M.'s tutorials once more if Rusty)
State management will be handled with prop drilling (yuck, but I can always refactor with Redux or Hooks, depending on time)

Add in simple Stripe and Google Maps integration (Stripe will be trivial, Maps is stretch)

Build out site by Sunday, full MVP functionanality by Monday 12:00 AM Hawaii time.

Sorry Brady, I'm terrible at time management, but this will be the first of three projects. Kanban is second, and a new React Panel/Trophycase will be the third, linked to my homepage. It will be taking inspiration from your website, just with less polish.

Now, let's try to get this done. This Readme will emulate my Labs project, and if time permits, my Kanban board project will also have a simple 2 page planning doc.
